Challenge Overview
Your task is to modify your blog landing page project by integrating state management to dynamically handle the blog posts array. This involves initializing state, updating state to add new posts, and implementing functionalities for editing and deleting posts.

Challenge Steps
Initialize State for Blog Posts

Update your App component to use state for managing the blog posts. Initially populate the state with a sample array of blog posts, each post containing at least a title and description.

Adding Blog Posts

Implement a feature that allows users to add new blog posts to your application. This should include a simple object variable that represents the new post and an add button. When the button is clicked, the new post should be added to the state, and the list of posts should update accordingly.

Editing and Deleting Posts

Add functionality to edit and delete existing blog posts.

For editing, allow users to modify the title and description of a post. Reflect these changes in the state to update the UI instantly.

For deleting, provide a way to remove a post from the array based on its unique identifier, updating the state and thus the UI.

Enhance Conditional Rendering

Utilize the state to enhance conditional rendering in your application. For instance, display a message like "No posts found" when the blog posts array is empty.

Optionally, implement conditional rendering to show and hide the edit form based on user interaction, such as clicking an edit button associated with a post.

State Management Best Practices

Ensure that all state updates are performed immutably, particularly when adding, editing, or deleting posts.

Consider using advanced state management techniques, like the useState Hook for functional components or setState in class components, especially for handling complex state updates.
