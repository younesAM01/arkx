Objective
Enhance your blog landing page project further by integrating React Router for navigation and adding a dedicated component for creating new blog posts. This addition introduces you to managing routes in a React application, allowing for a multi-page user experience and dedicated functionalities across different views.

Challenge Steps
Setting Up React Router

Install React Router by running npm install react-router-dom in your project directory.

Wrap your application in a <BrowserRouter> component in your index.js or App.js file. This component provides the foundation for navigation and routing in your app.

Create a basic routing setup in your App component using <Routes> and <Route> components to define paths for your application's views (e.g., home page, login page, sign-up page, and new post page).

Creating a New Post Component

Design a NewPostForm component that includes form fields for entering a new blog post's title, description, and any other relevant information you wish to include.

Implement state within this component to handle the form inputs and a method to submit the new post. On submission, the post should be added to the blog posts array in your application's state, and the user should be redirected to the home page where the new post is displayed.

Adding Navigation Links

Use the <Link> component from React Router to add navigation links in your application, enabling users to easily navigate to the login, sign-up, and new post form pages without reloading the page. Include these links in your navigation bar or menu.

Configuring Routes

Configure your routes in the App component to include paths for:

The home page (/) displaying the list of blog posts.

The login page (/login), showing the login form.

The sign-up page (/signup), showing the sign-up form.

The new post page (/new-post), displaying the NewPostForm for creating a new blog post.

Ensure that navigating to these routes displays the appropriate component.

Protecting Routes

As an advanced step, implement route protection for the new post page. It should only be accessible to users who are logged in. You can use conditional rendering within your routes to check the authentication state and redirect unauthenticated users to the login page.

Additional Guidelines
Route Management: Ensure your routing setup is well-organized and efficiently manages the different views of your application.

User Experience: Pay attention to the user experience when navigating between pages, especially regarding the authentication state and accessing protected routes.
