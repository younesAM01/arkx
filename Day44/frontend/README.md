Objective

Expand your blog landing page application by incorporating user authentication features. You will create login and sign-up forms, and manage user data through React state. This enhancement aims to simulate a real-world application scenario, introducing the concept of handling user inputs and state management for user authentication.

Challenge Steps

Designing the Authentication Forms

Login Form: Create a LoginForm component that includes fields for the user's email and password, and a submit button.

Sign-Up Form: Similarly, create a SignUpForm component that includes fields for the user's email, password, and any other relevant information you'd like to include (e.g., username), along with a submit button.

State Management for Authentication

In your App component, or in separate components if you prefer, initialize state to manage the user data. This should include states for handling the inputs from the login and sign-up forms.

Implement state to track whether a user is logged in or not. This will allow you to conditionally render different parts of your application based on the user's authentication status.

Handling Form Submissions

Write event handlers for the submission of the login and sign-up forms. These should update the relevant states with the user's input data.

Although we won't be integrating with a backend for this challenge, simulate the authentication process. For example, after a successful sign-up or login attempt (you can define what "successful" means in this context), update the state to reflect that the user is logged in.

Conditional Rendering Based on Authentication State

Use the authentication state to conditionally render content. For instance, display the login and sign-up forms only if the user is not logged in. Once the user is authenticated, show a logout button and perhaps a welcome message or the user's profile information.

Ensure there's a mechanism for the user to log out, which would update the state to reflect that no user is currently authenticated.

Enhancing User Experience

Provide feedback for user actions. This could include displaying error messages for invalid inputs or unsuccessful login/sign-up attempts, and confirmation messages for successful authentication.

Implement form validation to ensure the user inputs are in the correct format (e.g., a valid email address and a password that meets certain criteria).
